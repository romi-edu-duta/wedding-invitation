# Romina & Eduard's Wedding Invitation

Welcome to the GitHub repository for our wedding invitation website! We created this single-page site to share the details of our special day with friends and family across the world.

This project was built with love.

**Live Site:** [**https://romi-edu-duta.github.io/wedding-invitation/**](https://romi-edu-duta.github.io/wedding-invitation/)

---

The site is fully translated into Spanish, English, and Romanian, with a simple language switcher. A custom-styled form submits responses directly to a Google Sheet.
